/*
   First Approach -
    Traverse each element one by one and find that number. - Time:O(m*n)

   Second Approach -
    Apply binary search at each row or coloumn. Time: O(mlog(n)) - row
                                                        OR
                                                      O(nlog(n)) - coloumn

   Third Approach -
    Go to top right corner (0,col-1). If x is greater than that number move down ie increment x,
    ie movw down in another row. If x is left is less than that number move left in the same
    coloumn.
